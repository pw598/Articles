For many distributions, a closed-form cumulative density function (CDF) representing the accumulated sum or integral of the probabilities exists. All parametric distributions have ‘moments’ which include the expected value $E[Y]$ and the variance $Var[Y]$, with standard deviation equal to the square root of the variance.\n",
